			<p>The L2M report is a set of data released by the NBA after each close game that takes an analytical look at the final two minutes of down-to-the-wire games, analyzing each call made and not made by the referees, deeming them incorrect or correct. Today we will be looking at the information included within the last two minute reports of all 25 of the close 2024 playoff games to see what we could find out about the officiating.</p>

		<p>In the 2024 playoffs, according to data provided by the NBA's Last Two Minute (L2M) Reports, around 92 percent of calls made during the final two minutes of each game in the 2024 playoffs were reviewed and deemed correct. This statistic highlights the immense skill and precision NBA officials have to bring to the court every single night.</p>

				<p>When looking at the total number of incorrect and correct calls we found that 116 correct calls and no-calls were made compared to nine incorrect ones. This number is staggering even to me, the one who inputed all of this data into a spreadsheet. Whenever I watch an NBA game I find myself yelling at the referees on screen for making the “wrong call”. This data seems to shame my need to yell at the TV as, overwhelmingly, 93 percent of calls made were correct.</p> 

		<p>So is the hate justified? I don’t think so. These referees are hired by the NBA for a reason: they are the world’s best in their profession, a statement that can be concretely backed by the numbers. Officiating requires an immense level of skill and world-class split-second decision-making ability that can often go unnoticed or even unappreciated by most fans. But why is that?</p>

		<p>But is 93 percent really that accurate? Hypothetically, seven percent of made calls being incorrect could technically affect the final outcome of the games. For example, say there is a tie game with 1 second left and the offical incorrectly calls a shooting foul that causes the supposedly comitting team to lose the game. These instances rarely happen, especially in the playoffs. But, just to be sure, we checked the data.<P>
		<p>According to the numbers, there was only one instance where an incorrect call had a chance to change the game's outcome.<p>
			<p>With 16 seconds left in the April 20, 2024 matchup between the 76ers and Knicks, the refs incorrectly no-called a Jalen Brunson travel that would have given the 76ers the ball back while they were down four points. That being said, the 76ers lost the game by eight points, making the incorrect non-call esentially obsolete in regard to the game's outcome. It's impossible to quantify whether calling that travel would have swung the momentum of the game enough to give the 76ers an extra eight points to win that game.<P>

<P>Not fully convinced of the legitimacy of pro-level officiating yet? Okay, fine, then we'll use the data we've collected to find out if there are any team advantages when it comes to how NBA officials call the came. Using the information we've gathered from the L2M, we were able to find out how many fouls teams committed and received, on average, within the final moments of close playoff games.<p>
<p>Unfortunately for you reader, our findings didn't provide us with anything we haven't seen before. When it comes to both fouls comitted and received, no team saw any outlying advantages. These numbers are pretty typical for a basketball game. Concerns would only need to be raised if there were a clear outlier. Although one might believe that the Celtics are receiving much more fouls than their favorite team whenever they play, in reality, the averages come out to be suprisingly close.<p>

<p>When it comes to the narrative that referees are biased toward certain teams or consistently prone to error, the data speaks for itself. Not only do referees make calls that are steady in accuracy, but they do so consistently on a night in, night out basis. Even in the playoffs, when games become too close for comfort, spawning an heir of competitiveness that causes the participating athletes to play aggresively, officials are able to keep up both physically and mentally enough to perform their duties with outstanding precision.<p>

<p>So next time you find yourself blaming the referees for your favorite team's lackluster performances, remember, the numbers don't lie. The only one being biased here is us as fans, too blinded by our passion to recognize the importance and impressiveness of the the officials that keep the game running the way it should. With officials who consistently get it right over 90% of the time, it’s safe to say that the game is in good hands.</p>
