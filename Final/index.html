		<p>From the 1952 – 1953 season onward, officiating has played a crucial role in the NBA. Running up and down the court alongside players, the NBA officiators ensure the rules are being followed and call any fouls to maintain a fair, well-played game. This job requires an immense level of skill and world-class split-second decision-making ability that can often go unnoticed or even unappreciated by most fans. But why is that?</p>
		<p>TIn Basketball, especially toward the last two minutes of a game, one call can have a meteoric impact on deciding the winner. The power of the call can lead Fans to blame poor officiating for their team’s loss. It has famously happened throughout league history.  Take, for example, game 6 of the 2002 Western Conference Finals between the Sacramento Kings and Los Angeles Lakers. A win for Sacramento would have sent them to the finals, but, unfortunately for them, they let go of their big lead heading into the fourth quarter due to foul trouble.  The Lakers infamously shot 40 free throws, 27 in the fourth quarter alone, leaving the Kings' in foul trouble and with a loss. David DuPree, a USA Today sports journalist in 2002 said "I've been covering the NBA for 30 years, and it's the poorest officiating in an important game I've ever seen." It’s safe to say fans were outraged following the game, continuing to call it rigged to this day.</p>
		<p>Since then, so-called “poor officiating” continues to plague the league. At least, that’s what fans online say. In the age of social media, it has become easier than ever before to criticize a game’s officiating and blame it for the outcome. Fans have gone as far as to warn each other against certain referees calling a game in advance, as they have garnered a reputation for being unfair, spawning a slue of memes and online hate targeting said referees.</p>
		<p>But is the hate justified? I don’t think so. These referees are hired by the NBA for a reason: they are the world’s best in their profession. I took a look at the Last Two Minute Report for each game in the 2024 Eastern Conference, Western Conference, and NBA finals to find out whether the Refs were making correct calls or not. The L2M report is a set of data released by the NBA after each game that takes a close look at the final two minutes of down-to-the-wire games, analyzing each call made and not made by the referees, deeming them incorrect or correct. The sample size included seven close games and 125 calls made by officials.</p>
		<p>When looking at the total number of incorrect and correct calls we found that 116 correct calls and no-calls were made compared to 9 incorrect ones. This number was staggering even to me. Whenever I watch an NBA game I find myself yelling at the referees on screen for making the “wrong call”. This data shames my need to yell at the TV as, overwhelmingly, 93% of calls made were correct.</p> </div>
